His many years of service, including his former ownership of Flannery Yacht Sales, provide him with a fantastic foundation to build the IYBA brand on Florida’s East Coast. While he has extensive experience in many areas of yachting, in recent years he has leaned significantly toward the cruising markets. Pilothouse Motor yachts and Downeast cruisers are his primary focus, although he still remains close to his roots in the fishing business - demo data only.</p>",
